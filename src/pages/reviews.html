        <p class="review-text">"Dwaine came by on time and did an excellent job cleaning my dryer vent. He adjusted the vent hose so it would exhaust better, checked the roof discharge port and left the work space cleaner than before. I most highly recommend him and can't wait to see him next year; he put me on his calendar for next year's cleaning."</p>

        <p class="review-text">"Dwaine was amazing. Came right out as scheduled. Explained the importance of the thorough dryer vent cleaning to prevent fire. Did a thorough cleaning of the dryer vent including from up on the roof. Would 100% recommend him and his company."</p>

        <p class="review-text">"I called Dwaine at 9am for help at my elderly parents home. He was able to work me in same day. After completion of the job he explained in detail what he had done to clear the dryer vent. Punctual, quick and reasonable. Highly recommend."</p>

          <span>★★★★★</span>
        </div>
        <p class="review-text">"If you have recently had your roof replaced or repaired the roofers likely put a new dryer vent cap on which contains a screen. This screen quickly becomes clogged and your dryer has to work 3 times harder. Dwaine came and removed the screen and cleaned my vent and replaced a bad hose quickly and efficiently. Dryer works as it should again now! Highly recommend you have this done by All Around Home Care!"</p>
