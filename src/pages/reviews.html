        </div>
        <p class="review-text">"If you have recently had your roof replaced or repaired the roofers likely put a new dryer vent cap on which contains a screen. This screen quickly becomes clogged and your dryer has to work 3 times harder. Dwaine came and removed the screen and cleaned my vent and replaced a bad hose quickly and efficiently. Dryer works as it should again now! Highly recommend you have this done by All Around Home Care!"</p>
